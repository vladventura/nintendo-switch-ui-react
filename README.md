# Nintendo Switch UI Case Study
This is an attempt to replicate the NSW UI by using React. It is not a 1:1 replica and thus there are things that
might be slightly different.

You can move around, while a game/utility is highlighted, with WASD keys. You can also change the theme by pressing the T key.

Take a look at it here https://vladventura.github.io/nintendo-switch-ui-react
